# New-LockDown-Browser-Bypasser-2024-Method

Sup niggas ready for that final? Glad im here to help you! Everything is updated. Working 1000% undetectable! 

If you're dumb dont bother even trying and if you do not have two computers don’t even bother trying. Read the doc and get started niggas!

New method bypassing LockDown Browser, effective as of December 2024, shared here as my fall semester concluded. 

Fully undetectable and doesn’t require a virtual machine, though it does require access to two computers. 

This bypass helped me achieve an A my exam and made my professor look stupid as fuk.

Note:
I provided exe and dll to make it simpler for you. 
Undetectable until LockDown Browser recognizes the signatures. Use it while it lasts. 
If you want to take it a step further, consider using obfuscators. 
Pack the dll and exe with VMProtect and you should be good.
